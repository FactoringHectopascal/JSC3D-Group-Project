This is the final build of the game.

For replayability, I have added different difficulties. The player says something different depending on the difficulty, variety.

P is quicksave, and to quickload is L.
SOME SYSTEMS MAY HAVE TROUBLE QUICKLOADING, if this is the case please spam the L button until it works.

// for the person grading the project //

In the beginning of the game, save, then open the locker, pick up something, and then load. 
In the beginning of the game, save, use an item on something to open a door, then walk through that door until something happens, load.
You'll know what I mean once you're in there.

This is so that you can test the save system in a very cool way that shows everything that it can do.

I recommend medium difficulty, easy is very loose with the hints that it provides.

If you're having trouble with any of the puzzles please text my discord @morphogeneticfield

Please use the inspect button before you use the interact button, for the love of God.
